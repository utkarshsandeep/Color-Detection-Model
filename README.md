# Color-Detection-Model
Minor II Project for detection of some prescribed colors over a live image

Now in order to implement the setup and develop the model which would help as an aid for the color
blind people, some techniques and methods needs to be put in use which include libraries like NumPy,
OpenCV and a technique called Image Processing.

OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision) library aims at real time Computer Vision. It is mainly used to
do all the operations related to images.

NumPy is Python Package which stands for Numerical Python. This library consists of multidimensional
array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

Image Processing technique is used to perform some certain operations on an image, in order to get an
enhanced image as an output or to extract some useful information from the image. It acts as a type
signal processing in which input is an image and output may be an image or characteristics/features
associated with that image.
